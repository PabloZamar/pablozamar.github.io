Usability Reflection:
This user-friendly website prioritizes usability with a clean layout, readable fonts, and consistent color scheme, contributing to an intuitive user experience. 
However, more features could be added to improve the functionality and accessibility of the website. For example: incorporating more navigation aids, ensuring compatibility, creating more htmls to complete the website, etc. 
Further improvements can be made in providing clearer alternative text for images and enhancing interactive elements.
